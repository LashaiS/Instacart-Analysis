# Instacart-Analysis
A Python-based analysis of Instacart customer behavior, top products, and peak ordering times to support business decisions

## Objective
Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The task is to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data to give some insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the
same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target
different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they affect the sales of their products. 

## Key Questions

● What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders?

● Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?

● How can Instacart group products into simple price ranges to better support marketing and sales efforts?

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?

● What’s the distribution among users regarding their brand loyalty?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?

● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

● What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer
profiles?

## Code Overview 

Python in a Jupyter Notebook was used for all analysis and visualizations
Key Libraries

● pandas - main library for loading data, cleaning, merging, and exporting files

● NumPy - used for calculations and making new columns using conditions

● os - helps with file paths 

● matplotlib - for making charts and visualizations

● seaborn - for more style charts

*Note: This project uses a scenario inspired by Instacart, but the context and customer dataset have been fabricated for educational purposes.*
